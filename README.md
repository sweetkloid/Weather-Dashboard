# Weather-Dashboard
Challenge 6

## Description
We created this project to give the user an easy interface to view weather. By entering a city the user is able to see current and 5-day data of their selected city using an API. By adding an API we are able to pull data from another site and add it to our webpage for the user. By creating our own page we are able to narrow down the data we want to display when we pull from the API. We then created a way to reaccess those cities when the user clicks on them from previously searched cities. We then added a clear search history incase the user wants to get ride of their cluttered search history.
